		<h1>Course Description</h1>
		<p>This course is intended to be the definitive introduction to the Unity game engine. 
			Students will learn all the major skills necessary for game development, from scripting, 
			asset pipelines to sound integration among others, and leave the course with sufficient 
			foundation to confidently pursue more advanced topics in any specialization of their choice 
			related to game development in Unity. 
		</p>

		<p>This course is, however, NOT a game design course, and will not go into topics such as design documents, scoping, character, environment, level or narrative design.

<!-- Course Goals -->
<h1>Course Goals</h1>
<p>Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understand the role of common windows in the Unity Editor, including but not limited to the Scene, Project, Console, Game, Hierarchy and Inspector windows.
<li>Explain what an entity component system is and how it differs from object oriented programming.</li>
<li>Build custom components to drive gameplay behaviour by inheriting from Unity’s Monobehaviour class and accessing other built-in Unity components such as the Transform, Rigidbody or Collider components.</li>
<li>Create, import and implement assets with animations, both 2D and 3D.</li>
<li>Create custom shaders and visual effects using Unity’s Shader Graph package and ParticleSystem component</li>
<li>Implement sound using FMOD and Unity’s built-in sound system</li>

</ol>

<!-- Office Hours -->
<h1>Office Hours</h1>
<p>Every Sunday (starting September 20th) from 2:00-6:00pm, GCS holds open office hours via Zoom, where teams come to work in a collaborative environment. Students in the StuCo are also encouraged to come, especially while working on the two main course assignments, as listed below.</p>

<!-- Final Project -->
<h1>Final Project</h1>
<p>On top of what has been implemented in the assignments, students are expected 
	to implement 2 additional features of choice from a provided list. Everything 
	should then be consolidated and extended into a playable game. Students have 
	the option of either designing their own game or implementing a design provided
	 by the course. Students are expected to submit a build of their game as well
	  as a short writeup describing the additional features they’ve chosen to implement.
	All work is expected to be completed individually.
