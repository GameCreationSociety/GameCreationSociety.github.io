<h1>Course Description</h1>
<p>In this course students will learn the basics of game creation.
	The course is intended for both beginners and experienced game designers.
	In addition to project work done in class, students will learn fundamental tools like Unity.
</p>

<p>The intent of this course is to expand the community of game makers at CMU to those who are interested in making games but may not have had the inclination to pursue it through more intensive means such as G.C.S. or Ideate.
</p>

<p>The course also serves as an additional place for those already involved in the community to learn and collaborate.
	Tutorials and projects done in the student organization Game Creation Society will mirror and compliment work done in class.
