bio: "Bruce was a member of GCS for 4 years, during which time he participated in only a couple of semester-long projects (few of which were finished), but completed dozens of games for GCS 2-week-long game development contests and Global Game Jams. He later adapted one of his games, \"30 Second Life\", to be an iOS game, which did well. After graduation, he joined EA to work on \"The Sims 4\" for two years, before quitting to work on his own games for iOS, releasing \"Unshuffle,\" \"30 Second Life: Redux,\" and \"Triptoy.\" He is currently working on non-game-related projects and is a bit burnt out on the game industry, but still tinkers with game prototypes from time to time."
