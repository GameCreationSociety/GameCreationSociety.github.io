bio: "Programmer, game designer, Eagle Scout, and creator of this website! I discovered GCS during my very first semester here, and I've felt at home ever since.<br><br>
My experience in game development has also extended to the professional industry. In the summers of 2019 and 2020, I was an intern at Blizzard Entertainment on the initial design team for Hearthstone. Prior to that, I did web game development at The Game Agency."
