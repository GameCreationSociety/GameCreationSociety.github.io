bio: "Designer and indie dev. I'm a 50% feral adrenaline junkie who likes to travel, glassblow and fling themselves into the ocean, and a 50% nerd who likes video games, comics and books. 

I've been organizing one of the largest Global Game Jam sites in Tokyo, Japan since 2020, and am co-founder of Studio Terranova, an queer indie game company. We put out our first game, Terranova on Steam/itch.io on April 2021."
