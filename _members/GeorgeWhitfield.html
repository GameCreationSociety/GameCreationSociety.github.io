bio: "Hello! I'm George and I am a senior majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a minor in Game Design. I am fascinated by the intersection of computer science and art, which has motivated my interest in game development. I've worked on games as a musician, story writer, and a programmer. I'm pursuing a career in video game software development. 
<br>I've made a several games with Unity in and outside of GCS. I've also created a few games in C++ with OpenGL. I've dabbled a little bit with Unreal here and there.
<br>Here's a short list of my favorite games: Dance Dance Revolution, Minecraft, Starcraft II, Outlast 2, Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Skyrim, Oblivion"
