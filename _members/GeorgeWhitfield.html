bio: "Major: Electrical and Computer Engineering. Minor: Game Design<br><br>

I love playing and creating video games! Most of my experience is with Unity, but I have used Unreal too. I have worked on games as a musician, an artist, and a story writer but my main focus is programming. Check out my website for my resume and game portfolio!"
