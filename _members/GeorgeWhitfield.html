bio: "I’m majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering and I love video games! I play the piano and write music on my computer. I wrote the music for Danger Dancer and Starlight in the fall and spring semesters of my freshman year. In my free time I enjoy noodling around with Unity, however I have not created an entire game yet. I’m looking forward to learning and meeting new people in GCS!"
