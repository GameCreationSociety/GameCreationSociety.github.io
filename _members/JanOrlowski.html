bio: "I'm your run of the mill CS major with a game design minor. I've been bouncing around the games industry for a few years now and worked on titles like RUINER, Destiny 2 and Fortnite. I also make a lot of small games in my spare time, all of which can be found on my website. I have also lead a lot of game projects here at GCS, so I have pent up advice for anyone wanting to run projects."
