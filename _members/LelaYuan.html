bio: "Hi! I am Lela. I am majoring Decision Science and double minoring Human-Computer Interaction and Game Design! I joined GCS my sophomore year and I led the creation of a 2D puzzle RPG game Nannan (we won the GCS best art award!). I love playing puzzle games and horror games, and my favorite games are Sally Face, Rusty Lake and Until Dawn. I'm also super into escape rooms and have completed over thirty of them around the world! Hit me up if you are interested in making or playing games together!"
