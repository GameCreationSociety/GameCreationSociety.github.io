bio: "I am an undergraduate at CMU studying Computer Science and Music Composition. I'm extremely interested in creative sound implementation in games, and I love sound design and music creation of all kinds! I also enjoy game design and creatively designing around player motivation. Some of my inspirations are Transistor (or anything Supergiant), Overwatch, and Hollow Knight."
