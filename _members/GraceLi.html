bio: "Nice to meet you! I'm an undergraduate design major who loves story-driven games that stretch the bounds of my imagination. Some of my favorites are Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade, and Oxenfree.<br><br>

I joined GCS to meet new people and learn about interactivity. Character art and UI are my specialties!"
