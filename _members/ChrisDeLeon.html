bio: "Chris has been making games since 1997. He cofounded GCS in 2004, organizing the club's first several semesters. After graduation, Chris worked as a Technical Game Designer at Electronic Arts on Medal of Honor Airborne and Boom Blox, as an early hire at a Silicon Valley start-up (began by fellow GCS cofounder/alum, Curt Bererton), and co-developed iOS games with another GCS alum (John Nesky) both independently and through publisher arrangements. Chris attended graduate school at Georgia Tech in 2010. While at GT, he started a similar club, VGDev. In 2014, Chris left the PhD track to focus full-time on teaching independently online, including operating a worldwide adaptation of the pattern learned in these clubs, <a href=\"https://hometeamgamedev.com/\">HomeTeam GameDev</a> (formerly called Gamkedo Club). Outside of his main business, he's also helped curate IndieCade's speakers for 5 events, and is now leading the creation of an IndieCade alumni network. Chris serves on the board for the Los Angeles chapter of IGDA."
