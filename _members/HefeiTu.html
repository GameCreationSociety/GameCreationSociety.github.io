bio: "I am currently a student at CMU's School of Computer Science, majoring in AI. I enjoy playing games with a unique player experience and game mechanics. Making games with people who share the same passion has been a thrilling experience here at the GCS, and I look forward to meeting more people and learning from such experience!"
