bio: "Nice to meet you! I'm an AI major in my second year.<br>
I am still a beginner at game design and I was drawn in by indie games such as Undertale, Hiveswap, and the To the Moon series. I am amazed by how technologies have brought a new layer of experience to traditional story telling.<br>
I have currently only made games with Twine, but I am always eager to learn!"
