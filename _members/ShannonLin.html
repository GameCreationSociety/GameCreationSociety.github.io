bio: "I'm a BXA Design and Cognitive Science student interested in Animation and Special Effects! I'm not a veteran in creating games by any means, but I'm fascinated with the stylistic art and visual storytelling of games such as Monument Valley, Oxenfree, Sky: Children of Light, and OPUS. I specialize in art and environments.<br><br>

I'm familiar with Unity, Maya, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Procreate."
