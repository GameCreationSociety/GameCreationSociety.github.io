bio: "I am a undergraduate in the School of Computer Science with an interest in artificial intelligence, psychology, and game development. My interest in game development stems from experiences of playing video games with friends and the compelling stories that games can tell, and I want to help bring the same kind of happiness and wonder to others with the games I help make. 
<br/><br/>
Throughout my time in programming games, I have worked with Unity, Blender, and LOVE2D. However, I always want to keep adding onto my skillset, and I am especially excited about working with new technology such as VR and AR. 
<br/><br/>
I currently mostly play League of Legends and Escape from Tarkov, but some of my all-time favorites include Portal and Tetris Battle."
