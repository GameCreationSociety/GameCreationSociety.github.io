bio: "I'm an Art major minoring in Game Design. I love anything that has to do with 3D- level design, modeling, rendering, rigging, 3D printing, laser cutting...everything is so fun! I am familiar with Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and Audition. I also like to create works in Unity, Maya, Blender, Substance Painter, Ultimaker Cura, Meshmixer, and more! Can't wait to develop more fun games!"
