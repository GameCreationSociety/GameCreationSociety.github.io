bio: "I am currently a student at CMUâ€™s School of Computer Science, with minors in Game Design and Animation &amp; Special effects. I like to create interactive 3D experiences and research new ways to promote interaction between users and their devices. With new advances in VR and AR, I am excited to see what new levels of presence can be achieved.<br /><br />As Director of Development at GCS from 2016-2019, I helped develop the course materials for/teach the <a href=\"/course\">GCS StuCo</a>, helped run the GCS Pitch Fair, and assisted teams with technical issues.  Currently I am a TA for CMU's <a href=\"http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu\">15-462 Computer Graphics</a>.  I have additionally worked as a TA for CMU's <a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/\">15-122 Principles of Imperative Computation.</a>  During Summer 2019, I worked at Apple as an intern.<br /><br />Currently the majority of my personal projects are in the Unity game engine. I am currently exploring the fields of interactive design (that is, the interaction between humans and their devices, specifically in 3D applications) and computer graphics (rendering techniques to create convincing virtual worlds).
