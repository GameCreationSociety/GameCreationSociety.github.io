bio: "Marie is a game designer who graduated from CMU in 2021 and is now studying at CMU's Entertainment Technology Center to work with emerging technologies. She has done 3D modelling, animation, 2D art, and audio for the GCS games Slope Crusher, BLADE, and Food Fight. Her favorite part of GCS is scope creep and she'll probably forget to update this bio when she graduates from the ETC."
