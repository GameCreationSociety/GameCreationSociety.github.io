bio: "Hi, I'm an undergraduate student in computer science minoring in game design! I'm somewhat of a sucker for peaceful, story-based, 2D, single-player games and will never hesitate to gush about the artwork/story of a game (even though I definitely love talking about cool game mechanics too). I also do art as a hobby."
