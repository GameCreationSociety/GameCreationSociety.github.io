bio: "Hi, I'm Dom! I am an Applied Math major and I love making games. I joined GCS in Spring 2022 so I am pretty new to making games, but so far I love it!! I previously led Supreme Hen Donkey, and my favorite parts of making the game were integrating live action elements, bringing my teammates' wonderful hand-drawn animations to life, and sprinkling goofy jokes and Easter eggs throughout the game. Outside of making games, I also enjoy racket sports, particularly tennis and pickleball."
