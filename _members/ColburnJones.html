bio: "I'm a masters student studying the rhetoric of video games. I am interested in digital rhetoric and how new technologies change the way we write, what form our writing takes, and how we're able to deliver a message. I focus on interactive fictions and how interactivity changes how we communicate a message. I believe interactivity, when utilized correctly, can impact an audience on a greater scale, but it also brings some new challenges. I'm interested in answering how to create meaningful change based on audience's choice while not altering the essence of a text, how to create value from multiple interactions, how to make an interaction feel significant, and how to best utilize new technologies to reach and impact an audience."
