bio: "Hello, I'm Woody! I'm a senior in CS at CMU, and I love making games. I've worked on around 2 dozen games during my time here, and I've had a lot of fun on technically challenging and artistically interesting games. Aside from previously helping run GCS, I also taught the student course on game creation for 2 years, and currently teach a course on the design and play of Roguelike games."
