bio: "I am an undergrad at the School of Computer Science currently exploring game design/animation as a potential minor. I like to play and create simple 2D games in my free time, and want to expand into 3D games and animations. My favourite games are immersive story driven action games with amazing graphics and intuitive combat mechanisms. Some examples include: The Witcher 3, Batman Arkham City/Knight, and Shadow of Mordor."
