bio: "I was once a Biological Sciences major who double minored in Game Design and Creative Writing to distract myself from biological sciences. Currently, I make games at the Entertainment Technology Center as a grad student.<br><br>
Generally, I'm a game designer and programmer, but sometimes I make music and make mediocre 2D art. My goal is simply to make games that will bring joy to people and possess some unusual element. Most notably, a game I designed/programmed/produced is a permanent fixture in a public technology center in Cuba.<br><br>
When I was at CMU, I also taught the StuCo 'World Music: An Exploration,' where I introduced students to modern popular music from literally every country in the world, since international music is a big passion of mine. I also do a lot of improv comedy."
