bio: "I am a game programmer currently working as CTO of Anxious Oak Studios, an indie game studio I cofounded. While at CMU, I majored in biological sciences and double minored in game design and creative writing. I then went on to get my Masters at the Entertainment Technology Center and graduated from there in 2020.<br><br>
Notable games I worked on include The Unfathomed Voyager (selected for Alt.Ctrl.GDC 2020, shortlisted for IGF award), BROKE: The Game (selected for CHI PLAY 2019, Bronze Award winner at Serious Play 2019), Breakers (commissioned by the US Department of Homeland Security and served as the final round of the first President's Cup Cybersecurity Competition), and Wagonwheel (made a permanent fixture in a public technology center in Camag√ºey, Cuba).<br><br>
I also taught the StuCo 'World Music: An Exploration,' while at CMU, which taught about modern popular music from literally every country in the world, and was a member of CMU's improv troupe: The No Parking Players."
