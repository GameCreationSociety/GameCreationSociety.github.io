title: Angry Biker
year: 2010
semester: Fall

description: "In this game you need to control the biker to dodge all the crazy cars and pedestrians in the streets. You need to deliver the pizza to the destination (marked with a pizza flag) before time is out. Okay.... it's unbelievable that you don't die when you hit a car or something else. All you can lose is your speed, and time.... pedal very hard by pressing the same direction key multiple times. That's the only way to speed up!"
