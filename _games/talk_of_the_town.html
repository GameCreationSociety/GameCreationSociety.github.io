title: Talk of the Town
year: 2018
semester: Winter

description: "Convince as much of the town as possible that you are the party king and not your opponent. Prove to your fellow citizens that you really are the life of the party by completing the challenges they give you. Succeed, and they'll tell everyone that you truly party harder than everyone else, transmitting your charisma across the community. Convince the most people that you party the hardest, and you win.
