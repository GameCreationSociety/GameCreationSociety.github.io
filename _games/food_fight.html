description: "My name's Fry and as close as I can figure it...<br>
It's 2020 AD and I am fighting food.<br>
It wasn't always like this. I had a real life once:<br>
<br>
A job...<br>
A tasty sandwich...<br>
A cabin in the woods....<br>
Now all that remains.... is the Food Fight.<br>
<br>
Please read the README in the download for more information!"
