description: "Unique twist on a 2D space-shooter.<br><br>
Starbound Upgrade, a revamp of the original Starbound, is a unique twist on the standard top-down space shooter. It features a game concept of evading enemies rather than directly attacking them. The primary goal of the player is to manipulate the enemies to try to force them to attack each other. It features an arcade mode where you can play for score or a story mode where you follow the tale of a guy out to save the galaxy."
