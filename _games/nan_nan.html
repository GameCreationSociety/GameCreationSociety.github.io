description: "Nan Nan is a 2D puzzle RPG game combining northern Chinese Folktales and cosmic horror to create a uniquely unsettling experience. The game uses nonlinear narratives to tell the life story of a ten-year-old girl, Nannan, and how she fights for a new life by solving the mystery of her hometown. From time looping to turn-based battle systems, the game uses a variety of gameplay mechanics and art styles to investigate questions of gender inequality, cultural values and religion."
