description: "CRC_Fatal_Error<br><br>
Shotgun Debugger is a 2D, top-down action game. It is The Future, and your habit of computer network exploration has finally done you in.
You are captured and taken to a strange underground complex populated by robot soldiers.
Your task is to escape the facility -- but the hordes of walking death machines aren't just gonna let you."
