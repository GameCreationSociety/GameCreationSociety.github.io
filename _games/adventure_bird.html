semester: Spring

description: "Adventure Bird is a 3D Platformer game that took inspiration from a variety of famous 3d platformers such as 'Super Mario Sunshine' and 'A Hat in Time'. In this game you explore the beach town of Seagull Cove and try to hunt down the treacherous bird in a trenchcoat. This game was our team's best effort at producing our own 3D platformer and we believe that we met most of our initial goals.

Controls: wasd to move. Use spacebar to jump/double jump. Left Click to attack and use the mouse to move your camera. Use left shift to glide. The red wheel shows your health and the green wheel shows your stamina for gliding. Collect kiwi coins and defeat crows to get points. Collect heart tokens to recover lost health. You can also grab ledges, which will help you traverse the map.

Have fun, explore, and thanks for taking the time to look at our game."
