description: "In Fly Game, you play as a hungry fly in need of some nourishment. Gain points by flying into food, and keep your speed high for a better score! Beware of going too fast and too far, though; boosting takes up energy, and if you run out early, it's game over!<br><br>

Controls:
Mouse - Change direction of flight
Spacebar - Boost"
