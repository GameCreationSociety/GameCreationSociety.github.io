year: 2021
semester: Spring

description: "Escape From Lab 8 is a roguelike dungeon crawler, where you play as a unnamed test subject who must complete a deadly challenge to keep their life. As you play, you'll encounter 4 procedurally generated floors, filled with over a dozen unique monsters, more than 50 items, and many game-redefining artifacts. Choose an artifact that suits your playstyle, assemble a build around it, and count your Professor Salts carefully, or else you'll never... Escape From Lab 8."
