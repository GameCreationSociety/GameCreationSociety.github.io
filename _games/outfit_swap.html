description: "Go from burger-flipper to US President by swapping outfits with people.<br>
Welcome to Outfit Swap, the game where you move up the social ladder by swapping outfits with people. President Connor has enacted the One-Man-One-Outfit policy, which outlaws people from changing outfits. However, you are dissatisfied as a Burger-Flipper in BcDonaldâ€™s and decide to rebel. Other characters are also secretly dissatisfied with their roles and will switch with you if they like yours better. The goal is to work your way up to become the President of the United States. Good Luck!"
