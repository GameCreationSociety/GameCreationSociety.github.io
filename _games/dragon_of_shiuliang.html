year: 2004
semester: Spring

description: "First GCS game ever!<br><br>
The Dragon of Shiuliang has met its original goal of recreating the spirit of Dragon Warrior. Featuring many separate regions to explore, 50 NPCs, original music, art, and dialog, world persistence, and scripted cinema sequences, DoS has shaped up into a finished and complete RPG in its own right. It's written in C++ using the Allegro library, and the entire source is included in the download. Included binaries are compiled for IBM/Windows PCs. Read the readme.txt for further details."
