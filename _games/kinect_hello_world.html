title: Kinect Hello World
year: 2011
semester: Fall

description: "An experiment using the Microsoft Kinect for a GCS project.
<br><br>
The goal was to see what it took to get the Kinect working and whether it was possible to do so in a reasonable amount of time. The result is a resounding \"yes\". This is a functional, if buggy, rail shooter using the Kinect as a controller."
