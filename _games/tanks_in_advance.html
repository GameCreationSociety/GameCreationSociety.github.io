title: Tanks in Advance
year: 2023
semester: Spring

description: "Tanks In Advance takes a simple 1v1 tank game and adds a time-traveling twist! Each round, record your movements as you try to destroy the other player's tanks. Then, in the next round, battle alongside your past selves from previous rounds to defeat your opponent. Tanks In Advance features 5 different types of tanks, giving you plenty of room for creative, mind-bending strategies.

<br><br>To win, destroy all your opponents' tanks in the final round, or have more tanks in the central circle when time runs out! If your current tank dies, you will be able to still move and record movements as a ghost. These movements will play out if your tank survives in a future round. 

<br><br>Controllers are *strongly* recommended!
Movement: Left Stick / WASD + OKL;
Aim: Right Stick / TFGH + arrow keys
Shoot: Right Bumper / L+R Shift
