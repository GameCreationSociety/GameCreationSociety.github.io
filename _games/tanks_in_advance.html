description: "Tanks In Advance takes a simple 1v1 tank game and adds a time-traveling twist! Each round, record your movements as you try to destroy the other player's tanks. Then, in the next round, battle alongside your past selves from previous rounds to defeat your opponent. Tanks In Advance features 5 different types of tanks, giving you plenty of room for creative, mind-bending strategies.

<br><br>Controllers are *strongly* recommended!
Movement: Left Stick / WASD + OKL;
Aim: Right Stick / TFGH + arrow keys
Shoot: Right Bumper / L+R Shift
