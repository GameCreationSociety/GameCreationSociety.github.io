semester: Fall

description: "Two empires battle for control over the land. But whether they nurture or neglect the nature around them is a choice of its own. Play as an industrious or environmentalist empire, or forget the troubles of human conflict and play as the Earth itself, fostering beautiful forests and animal ecosystems. Regardless of your goals on this planet, keep one eye on the climate, lest there is nothing left to fight for."
