description: "An online (?) multiplayer (?) game. Room 11 is a secret area. The game announcer wants to enslave you. In-game ads give you money. Your opponent is invisible. Collect as many products as you can and toss them into the soup to make the most flavorful meal of all time. Products of course vary in flavor."
