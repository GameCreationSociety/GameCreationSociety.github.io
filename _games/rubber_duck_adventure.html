title: Rubber Duck Adventure
year: 2014
semester: Fall

description: "Rubber Duck Adventure is a game where you control a rubber duck floating down a hazardous river. Using the W, A, and D keys, you must keep the duck afloat for as long as possible. But watch out! Spike turtles, herons, and crocodiles in hats will try to damage the duck! Get hit 3 times and it's game over. The game's charming story book-like aesthetic is accompanied by a small orchestral piece performed by students within Carnegie Mellon's own School of Music. Also, there are 6 collectible hats."
