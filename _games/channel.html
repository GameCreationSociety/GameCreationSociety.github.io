description: "Channel is a collective investigation of the varying nature of parent-child relationships. Divided into groups, the project resulted in three mini-games, each expressing a unique perspective about our day-to-day familial interactions. For the best experience, please tune in for all three channels!<br><br>
For more in-depth information about the development of Channel, please visit the dev's blog at <a href='https://medium.com/@gzliu777'>https://medium.com/@gzliu777</a>"
