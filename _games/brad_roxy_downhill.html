title: Brad & Roxy's Amazing Downhill
year: 2005
semester: Fall

description: "Ski down the mountain before the yeti catches you!<br><br>
Brad and Roxy are tabloid photographers convinced of the existence of a race of yetis. Unfortunately, the flash of their camera wakes them up in their native habitats in high mountains, and it's a race to the finish before they become lunch. There's nothing more challenging than out-skiing a yeti on a hover board."
