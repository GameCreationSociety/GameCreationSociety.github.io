description: "<em>Dearest Magdaline, <br>
The time has come to put your wizardry skills to the test. As you are already aware, senior students at Lingua Litis Academy for Wizards must duel a member of the teaching faculty before leaving the Academy.<br>
We humbly request that you come to the Grand Library later this evening. Professor Skull shall act as your examiner.<br>
Best Wishes,<br>
M</em><br><br>
Lingua Litis is a 2 player turn based fighting game. Each player spells words in order to cast spells at the opponent.<br><br>
