description: "3D platforming at its finest!<br><br>
Power Monkey's 7-year old boy has left for the evening for a sleepover, and now he must protect the boy's room at all costs and find all of the missing bananas! In this 3rd/1st-person adventure game, you must collect all of the bananas by exploring the room into the jungles of the closet all of the way to the depths beneath the bed, and all this before the boy returns! Good luck, Power Monkey, and don't let the bed bugs bite!"
