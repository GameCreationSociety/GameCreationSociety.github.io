title: Cute and Deadly Dolphins
year: 2017
semester: Spring

description: "Dolphins are good at many things: being cute, basketball, jumping through hoops, and so on. However, did you know they are also good fighters?! Play as a cute and rubbery dolphin and beat the crap out of your opponent using your fins, starfish, maybe even a shotgun! Show the other player NO MERCY and show them who's the cutest dolphin in the ocean! Are you going to be the best or are you going to be sleeping with the fishes tonight? Find out and give the game a try!"
