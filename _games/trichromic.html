description: "Multiplayer Turn-Based Strategy.<br><br>
Create units, capture buildings, and attack the enemy in an attempt to conquer the map. The three armies have their own strengths, weaknesses, and special units: Crimson is powerful. Cobalt is crafty. Pine is numerous. It's up to you to decide who wins.<br><br>
You can play multiplayer (hotseat or over a network) or on your own against the AI, and maps can be created and edited with a built-in map editor.<br><br>"
