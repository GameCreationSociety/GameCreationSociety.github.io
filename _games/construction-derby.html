title: Construction Derby
year: 2020
semester: Winter

description: "When the world is ravaged by nuclear fallout, there is only one way to repair things...by destroying something first! Participate in the grand Construction Derby where you destroy your opponent’s cars while simultaneously repairing and improving your own. Be careful, as the hosts of this competition are not privy to fair play, and many brutal traps await those who enter. Keep fighting and be the last one left driving! Achieve glory as you smash your friend's vehicles to bits and add them to your own!"
