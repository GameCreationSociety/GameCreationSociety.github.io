description: "Command Battleship 88 to victory!<br><br>
It's World War II, and every encounter is to kill or be killed. As captain of Battleship 88, you know that the entire crew is well trained and prepared for battle. Expertly conducted, your crew - and thus your ship - can operate as an extension of your body and mind. Only by thinking on your feet, knowing your enemy, and capitalizing on your every opportunity can Battleship 88 make it safely back home to America. Your men are counting on you.<br><br>
