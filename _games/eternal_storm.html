description: "Isometric space-age bombing game.<br><br>
Taking place in 3305 A.D, Eternal Storm dives into the rich clouds of Jupiter, where the Juno Corporation uses automated mining platforms to maintain a monopoly on the collection of Hydrogen-3 fuel.
Inside the Great Red Spot of Jupiter, a monstrous storm three times the size of Earth, Juno is rumored to have found the storm's source.
Hidden by the fury of this storm, a few brave pilots launch a rebellion -- the Jupiter Liberation Front -- seeking to strike Juno in its heart to uncover the source of its secrets."
