title: "Bossmen"
year: 2008
semester: Spring

description: "Cubes and Lasers<br><br>
Bossmen consists of seven unique boss battles. You are a \"hero\", equipped with a lasergun and jetpack to defeat the Bossmen. The game has a typographic health system, with parts of the characters’ names disappearing as damage is taken.<br><br>
An astute observer might ask, why are you fighting? Can’t we all get along? Well, being cubist, the Bossmen have taken a disliking to your supple round corners and high polygon count. And for Bossmen, disputes are not solved by words, but by lasers."
