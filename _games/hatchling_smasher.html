title: Hatchling Smasher
year: 2005
semester: Fall

description: "Save the patient by smashing all the parasite eggs, classic arcade style!<br><br>
Hatching Smasher is all about frenzied alien larvae destruction in true pick-up-and-play fashion.
Navigate the puck to break eggs before they hatch, but watch out - you need to clean up any parasites that hatch before they escape.
What's worse, some of the aliens are evolving, making them large and aggressive game bosses!
And of course, no arcade game is complete without powerups tied to each section of the game."
