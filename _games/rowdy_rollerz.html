title: Rowdy Rollerz
year: 2004
semester: Fall

description: "Rollz your way to victory!<br><br>
Rowdy Rollerz isn't like other puzzle games you've played - there are no falling blocks, no matching shapes, and no sticky bubbles. Rowdy Rollerz is a game where you control the world itself, and have to handle that omni-potent control to steer a ball from its source to its target."
