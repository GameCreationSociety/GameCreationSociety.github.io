description: "Randomly-generated Old School madness<br><br>
Ah, the classic 2-D, side scrolling, combat/adventure game.
But why settle for a single game, when Re-Retro brings you a different experience every time.
Every level is hot out of the oven, generated right at the loading screen.
Also, ninjas."
