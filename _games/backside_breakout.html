year: 2018
semester: Fall

description: "Backside Breakout is a prison break role-playing game. Gameplay is turn based with multiple turns a day before players have to move back to their cells and lose any items not properly hidden. The most convenient place to stash items is in one's rectum, hence the title Backside Breakout. The game is won by fulfilling one of three different escape routes, possibly involving bribery, disguises, or a copious amount of spoons.<br>
<br>
This game was created at the 2018 Pittsburgh IGDA Board Game Jam, for the theme: \"Freedom\"."
