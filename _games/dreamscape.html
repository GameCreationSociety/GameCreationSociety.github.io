description: "2D Fighter smoother than butter.<br><br>
Dreamscape is a fresh take on a classic genre, the 2D fighter, set in a restless world of imagination created by the collective dreaming of every living thing on earth. The King Dreamer of this world is going into retirement, so a new king must be found! Play as the King Dreamer, Shaktool Fremont, and his would be successors: a collection of characters including squid ladies, school girls, and a foetus controlled robot (?!)."
