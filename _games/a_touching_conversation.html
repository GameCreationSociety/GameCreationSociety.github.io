title: A Touching Conversation
year: 2019
semester: Spring

description: "A conversation game about touch. After filling out a preliminary survey, players on either side of the wall place their hands into the box. They will then be prompted with charades style questions based on the comfort level inferred from the survey. Players must attempt to communicate complex ideas using only their hands.

This game was created for Carson's Intro to Contextual Practice at CMU."
