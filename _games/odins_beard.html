title: Odin's Beard
year: 2018
semester: Fall

description: "Odin's got the finest beard in the Nine Realms - at least, that's what he wants to believe. He's getting increasingly more jealous of his arch-rival, Surtr, whose beard has begun to rival Odin's own in its magnificence. To this end, he's summoned you, a Viking barber, to defeat Surtr and his leagues of minions by reducing their beards to pitiful whiskers. Controls: - Move left/right with AD - Jump with Space or W - Attack with Enter/Return - In air, you'll do a pinwheel attack like a Screw Attack - On ground, when you have 3HP, you'll fire a projectile"
